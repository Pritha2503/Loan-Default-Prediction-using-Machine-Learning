# Loan-Default-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Overview

This project aims to predict whether a borrower will default on their loan using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features about the loan, borrower, and loan repayment history. By analyzing this data, we can predict whether a loan is likely to be paid back or default.

The project uses machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build a model. Additionally, various data preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the dataset for training.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.

Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating important features that can improve model performance.

Model Training: Building and training a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Prediction: Making predictions on new data or test data.
